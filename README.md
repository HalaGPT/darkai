## üî• Project Overview
DarkAI aims to be a compact, self-hostable toolkit that demonstrates a practical web UI for common AI media tasks:
- Image ‚Üí Video (generate short clips from a single image + prompt)  
- Text ‚Üí Video (generate short clip from a text prompt)  
- Image editing & generation (tools named _gemini_ and _flux_ in the UI)

This repository is intended as a base for customization, integration with AI backends, and experimentation.
